# NLP for French Archaeological Reports - ARIADNEplus

This corpus was created within the Task 16.8 of the [ARIADNEplus project](https://ariadne-infrastructure.eu/). It was annotated with [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/) (Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt) and consists of six archaeological reports so far. 

Two types of entities were annotated and linked to the [Pactols](https://pactols.frantiq.fr/opentheso/) Knowledge Base for the moment: chronological references (CHRONO) and physical finds (MOB).

The data is available in two formats: CoNLL 2002 and WebAnnoTSV v.3.3.
